            <h1 class="header1">Welcome To The NHS Quit Smoking Website</h1>
            	<h2 class="header2">Our goal</h2>
                <p class="indexp">This website was created to by the NHS to help raise awareness for smoking and encourage those who do, to quit and hopefully improve their lives and other around them. <br /><br />Here you can find a gallery of shocking images related to smoking; a list of shocking statistics; and a data capture form that will log your information and produce a set of results that tell you your BMI (Body Mass Index) Rating; Blood Pressure and whether or not we believe you should consult your GP.
                <p class="indexp">If you smoke, giving up is probably the biggest single step you can take to improve your health.
Smoking is responsible for one in every five deaths in adults aged over 35 in England, and half of all long-term smokers will die prematurely due to a smoking-related disease.
Giving up smoking increases your chances of living a longer and healthier life, even if you've smoked for 40 years. You'll start to notice the benefits soon after quitting. For example:</p>
				<ul>
                	<li>after one month your skin will be clearer, brighter and more hydrated</li>
                    <li>after three to nine months your breathing will have improved, and you will no longer have a cough or wheeze</li>
                    <li>after one year your risk of heart attack and heart disease will have fallen to about half that of a smoker</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="header2">NHS Stop Smoking Service</h2>
                <p class="indexp">If you want to quit smoking, it's a good idea to see your GP who can provide help and advice about quitting, and refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking service. These services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking.<br /><br />
Studies show that you're four times more likely to quit smoking if you do it through the NHS. You can make an appointment without seeing your doctor by calling the NHS Stop Smoking helpline on 0300 123 1044 (England only).<br /><br />Read more about <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/smoking/Pages/NHS-stop-smoking-adviser.aspx" target="blank">how NHS stop smoking advisers can help you to quit.</a></p>
				<h2 class="header2">Stop smoking help from your GP</h2>
                <p class="indexp">If you don't want to go to an NHS Stop Smoking service, your GP can still offer treatment to help you quit.<br /><br />
You'll be assessed to get an idea of your level of addiction and to outline the benefits of quitting. This is also a chance to identify potential triggers, such as if you live with others who smoke or you're under stress.<br /><br />Your GP can prescribe several different stop smoking treatments. The type prescribed will depend on your personal preference and whether you've used any before.

				<h2 class="header2">Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)</h2>
                <p class="indexp">After smoking for a while your body adapts to getting regular doses of nicotine from your cigarettes. When you stop smoking you quickly remove the nicotine in your body. This means you suffer withdrawal, leading to: </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Bad moods</li>
                    <li>Feeling irritable</li>
                    <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                    <li>A craving for cigarettes</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indexp">Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) works by releasing nicotine steadily into your bloodstream at much lower levels than in a cigarette, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. This helps control your cravings for a cigarette  when your body starts to miss the nicotine from smoking and improves your mood.</p>
